# **OpenGLESPro**

This is a `OpenGL ES` advanced learning project for Android, and I will continue to code and commit samples and write chinese and english commets for some import code.

I will publish some Android OpenGL ES advanced learning articles on my **juejin**, including the articles related to every samples in this project, and other knowledge.  Welcome! Link: https://juejin.im/user/5afabe81f265da0b7b361036/posts



Now, this project contains the following samples.



- **SampleShader**

    A sample demonstrates the usage of location in OpenGL 3.0 shader.

- **SampleTextureArray**

  A sample demonstrates the usage of texture array. In the fragment shader, we use sampler2DArray to hold an array of texture.

- **SampleBinaryProgram**

  A sample demonstrates the usage of binary GL program. We can save the linked GL program to file and load a binary GL program from file.

  

- **SampleFenceSync**

  a sample of using fence to synchronize the GL commands.

- **SampleMultiRenderTarget**

  This is a sample of multiple render targets, with which we can render to multiple textures at a time

  

- **SampleVBOAndIBO**

  This sample demonstrates the usage of VBO(Vertex Buffer Object) and IBO(Index Buffer Object)

- **SampleEGL**

  This sample demonstrates the usage of EGL
